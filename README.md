# Calculator Project

This is a simple calculator program written in Python that can perform basic arithmetic calculations and read equations from a text file.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Handle division by zero.
- Read equations from a text file and display the results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to either perform calculations or read equations from a file.

## Sample Equations File

The calculator can read equations from a text file. Each equation should be written on a new line, in the format `num1 operator num2`. For example:

```
10 + 5
8.5 * 3
7 / 2
